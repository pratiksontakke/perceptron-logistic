# Reflection on Logistic Regression Implementation

## Initial vs Final Model Predictions
The initial model, with randomly initialized weights, made predictions that were essentially random guesses with approximately 50% accuracy. This is because the initial weights were small random numbers centered around zero, making the initial sigmoid outputs close to 0.5 for all inputs. As training progressed, the weights were adjusted to capture the meaningful patterns in the data, leading to more accurate predictions based on the fruit's physical characteristics.

## Learning Rate's Effect on Convergence
The learning rate played a crucial role in the model's training process. It's like a "step size" that determines how much we adjust our model's parameters in response to errors:
- Too large a learning rate (e.g., > 1.0) caused the model to overshoot the optimal values, leading to unstable training
- Too small a learning rate (e.g., < 0.01) made the model converge very slowly
- The chosen rate of 0.1 provided a good balance, allowing steady convergence without overshooting

## The DJ Knob Analogy
Think of tuning the learning rate like a DJ adjusting their mixing knobs:
- If they turn the knob too quickly (high learning rate), they might overshoot the perfect sound level
- If they turn it too slowly (low learning rate), it takes forever to reach the desired volume
- Just like a DJ learns to make smooth adjustments, our model needs the right learning rate to smoothly converge to optimal weights
- A child learning to ride a bike follows a similar principle: taking steps that are neither too big (falling over) nor too small (not making progress)
